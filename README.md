## OpenMRS Lab Tracking Application

### Description
The Lab Tracking Application is a stand-alone Pathology application that can be used within the current EMR.  This app can be used to request tests that need to be performed on a patient and track the tests as the specimen is taken and then updated with results.  The test details are viewable both at a patient level and when monitoring the entire lab process.
